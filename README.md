# Mental Well-being in the Tech Industry

Project-1 Repository contains the **analysis, code, and visualizations** for the **Mental Health in Tech Survey (2017)**. We explore factors influencing mental well-being in the tech industry and provide actionable insights for improved workplace support.

---

## Overview

- **Demographics**: The impact of age, gender, and roles on mental health.
- **Workplace Factors**: Effects of company size, work hours, remote work, and wellness programs.
- **Mental Health Outcomes**: Prevalence of anxiety, depression, and treatment-seeking behavior.

Using statistical analysis and visualizations, we aim to uncover trends and correlations that can inform meaningful interventions.

## Data Source

The analysis is based on the **2017 Mental Health in Tech Survey**, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey).
