    "# Mental Well-being in the Tech Industry - Analysis Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains all code, analysis, and data visualizations used in the exploratory data analysis of the mental health survey conducted within the tech industry through analysis of the \"Mental Health in Tech Survey\" dataset. This project investigates factors influencing mental well-being within the tech industry, using statistical analysis and visualizations.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to understand the relationships between demographic factors (age, gender, role, company size), work-related factors (work hours, remote work, benefits), and mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, treatment seeking) in the tech sector. We analyze the prevalence of mental health conditions, identify potential risk factors in the tech workplace, and assess the effectiveness of company wellness programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to investigate factors impacting mental well-being, with a focus on identifying patterns in mental health issues, treatment-seeking behavior, and workplace support mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The repository analyzes data from the **Mental Health in Tech Survey**, providing insights into mental health-related issues across different demographics, roles, company sizes, and countries within the tech industry. Key findings include statistical trends in mental health treatment-seeking behavior, support programs, and work interference due to mental health. Visualizations, descriptive statistics, and predictive modeling are used to uncover correlations and trends in the data, with an aim to inform potential interventions and areas for further research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this analysis comes from the OSMH/OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey, covering 2014. The dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey\n",

    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "   - Standardizes categorical variables, manages missing data, and handles age outliers.\n",
    "   - Focuses on tech-related responses by filtering out non-tech respondents.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:\n",
    "   - Includes visualizations for gender distribution, mental health consequence expectations, and treatment-seeking behavior by demographic factors.\n",
    "   - Compares treatment-seeking behavior rates in relation to company size, wellness program discussions, and leave policies.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Statistical Analysis**:\n",
    "   - Chi-squared and regression analyses are used to identify key predictors of mental health treatment-seeking behavior.\n",
    "   - Correlation matrix and feature importance visualizations highlight significant variables affecting mental well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Predictive Modeling**:\n",
    "   - Logistic regression models predict mental health treatment-seeking behavior based on workplace and demographic factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Country-Specific Insights**:\n",
    "   - Analysis of treatment-seeking behavior across different countries, revealing cultural and policy-driven differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - Suggested interventions based on observed trends, such as tailored support programs, enhanced workplace culture, and region-specific support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis requires Python 3 and the following packages:\n",
    "- `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation and numerical analysis.\n",
    "- `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`: Data visualization.\n",
    "- `scikit-learn`, `statsmodels`: Statistical modeling and feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the repository:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone <repository-url>\n",
    "   cd mental-health-tech\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To run the analysis, navigate to `notebooks/` and open the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The report summarizing the findings is available in `report/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis employs several techniques, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Descriptive Statistics and Visualization: Distributions, frequencies, means, and visualizations (histograms, pie charts, bar plots) are used to understand the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Correlation Analysis: Relationships between variables are examined using correlation matrices and scatter plots with regression lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature Engineering and Selection: Categorical features are encoded, and a chi-squared test is employed for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression): Logistic regression with L1 regularization (Lasso) is used to model the relationship between features and treatment-seeking behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Findings (Summary)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Gender Disparity: A significant gender imbalance exists in the tech industry, potentially contributing to disparities in mental health experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Work-Related Factors: Work interference and access to mental health benefits are significantly associated with mental health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Wellness Programs: Effective wellness programs that address mental health show promise in improving treatment-seeking behavior.\n",
